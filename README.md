# mas_tutorials

A collection of tutorials for using the functionalities developed by the b-it-bots team at Hochschule Bonn-Rhein-Sieg. Tutorials are presented in Jupyter notebooks since this allows textual descriptions, equations, and code to be interleaved nicely.

## Existing tutorials

### Domestic Robotics

* [Architecture](domestic_robotics/architecture.ipynb): Describes the main design principles behind the domestic architecture and its intended usage

## Contributing

To add a new tutorial, please fork the repository, create a `feature/<short-tutorial-name>` branch (branch off of `master`), and add your tutorial notebook to an appropriate directory (for example, if the tutorial is about domestic robotics, add it to the `domestic_robotics` directory); the name of the notebook should be descriptive of the tutorial. After creating the tutorial notebook, add a link to it in this README file and create a pull request to the `master` branch.
